## Creators: Adit Dhawan, Paritosh Panda, Shriman Visahan

## Requirements

1. Install [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)
2. Clone the project
3. `cd movieflix`
4. `git fetch origin`
5. `git checkout adit` or `git checkout shri`
6. `git push -u origin adit` or `git push -u origin shri`
7. I have made remote branches with your names so do all your work on that only. When you push code, it will be pushed to the remote branch of the same name. Whenever you want to merge with the main just make a pull request, I'll handle it uske aage. I'll try not to fuck it up but let's see.
8. Run `pipenv install`, this will install all the dependencies. Right now it is nothing except Pylint. I would recommend using Pylint because it has good linting errors and it will help us keep the code consistent. I have already added the configuration file so you guys don't have to do anything except make your editor use pylint as well.
